<h1>Share Recipes</h1>
<p>This project was made to practice Next.js with the getStaticProp and getStaticPath pre-rendering functions. It is a site about sharing your recipes, rating and commenting on others. The user can fill up a form in the Add Recipe section and make a post request to share his own idea or visit the Recipes section where he makes a get request to see, rate, or comment on other ideas.</p>
